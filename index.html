          <h3>Law Quadrangle</h3>
          <p>
            Built in 1924-1933, this group of Collegiate Gothic Revival-style buildings were designed by York and Sawyer
            and gifted by University of Michigan alumnus William Wilson Cook to house the University of Michigan’s Law
            School. The buildings are clad in rough-hewn stone with gabled roofs, bay windows, leaded casement windows,
            towers at the entrance bays, decorative stone trim, and arched entrance bays. The buildings are contributing
            structures in the University of Michigan Central Campus Historic District, listed on the National Register
            of Historic Places in 1978.

          <h3>Museum of Art</h3>
          <p>
            Built in 1908-1910, this Classical Revival-style building was designed by Donaldson and Meier to serve as
            the Alumni Memorial Hall for the University of Michigan, home to the university’s alumni department, which
            moved out of the building in 1967 due to the expansion of the other tenant of the building, the University
            of Michigan Museum of Art. The building was renovated and expanded in 2009, under the direction of Brad
            Cloepfil and Allied Works Architecture, adding a new wing to the north of the original building and doubling
            the interior space of the museum. The original building is clad in limestone with a front doric portico,
            cornice with modillions, hipped roof, and paneled exterior, with the addition being clad in limestone and
            metal panels, with large glass curtain walls and windows placed irregularly around the exterior. The older
            section of the building is a contributing structure in the University of Michigan Central Campus Historic
            District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

          <h3>University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan</h3>
          <p>
            The University of Michigan (U-M, UM, UMich, or U of M), frequently referred to simply as Michigan, is a
            public research university in Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States. Founded in 1817 in Detroit as the
            Catholepistemiad, or University of Michigania, 20 years before the Michigan Territory became a state, the
            University of Michigan is the state's oldest university. The university moved to Ann Arbor in 1837 onto 40
            acres (16 ha) of what is now known as Central Campus. Since its establishment in Ann Arbor, the university
            campus has expanded to include more than 584 major buildings with a combined area of more than 34 million
            gross square feet (781 acres or 3.16 km²) spread out over a Central Campus and North Campus, has two
            satellite campuses in Flint and Dearborn, and a Center in Detroit. The University was a founding member of
            the Association of American Universities. Considered one of the foremost research universities in the United
            States, the university has very high research activity and its comprehensive graduate program offers
            doctoral degrees in the humanities, social sciences, and STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering and
            Mathematics) as well as professional degrees in architecture, business, medicine, law, pharmacy, nursing,
            social work, public health, and dentistry. Michigan's body of living alumni (as of 2012) comprises more than
            500,000. Besides academic life, Michigan's athletic teams compete in Division I of the NCAA and are
            collectively known as the Wolverines. They are members of the Big Ten Conference.
